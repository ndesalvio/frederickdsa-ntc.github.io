  about: "<b>This is a starter website available for any DSA Chapter.</b> Democratic socialists believe both the economy and society should be run democratically to meet human needs, not to make profits for the wealthy. Throughout San Mateo County, from South San Francisco to Pacifica to East Palo Alto, our chapter fights for the good of the many, not the few."
  welcome: "Welcome to a Frederick DSA!"
